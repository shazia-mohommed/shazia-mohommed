I love exploring every aspect of technology and life—always upskilling and open to new opportunities. While I once dreamed of being a mechanical engineer, my curiosity led me to CSE, where I found an interest in IoT and all things tech. I enjoy learning from YouTube and hands-on projects, and I’m eager to dive deeper into the tech world!
